        <p> Since I have memory I know that photography is one of my biggest passions, I am the official photograper of my font-family
            In 2015, after a lot of savings during that year, I was able to finally buy my first DSLR camera, which was a Nikon D3200
            that I bought from eBay. Then, in 2016, I decided to try a more advanced camera for me, a Nikon D7100 that I also got from eBay.
            I do not do it professionaly, is more of a hobby, but so far I have used more than 25 cameras and over 50 different lenses, from zoom to prime lenses, which I will say that
            prime lenses are the best! Click on portfolio at the top to see some of my images.

        <p>Yes, I do have a YouTube Channel! Recently I have been trying to be more active and upload more content, the channel is in Spanish and it is mostly based on Tech products, usually from prior years
            and that can people can afford buying. If you would like to see my channel you can click the word YouTube at the very bottom of the page.

        <img class="colibri" src="images/nature.jpg" width="250px" alt="nature picture">
        <p>I believe that respecting animals and nature in general is the only way to really change the world. We share the same home with animals and plants, so I believe that 
            that we should take care of them and they will take of us. I have 6 dogs that I love dearly. If I can one day, I would build an animal rescue shelter.

        <p>From computers, cellphones, TV's, cameras, smartwatched, anything that has to do with technology, I have to check it out. I find incredible
            how we can create such things and implement them in society.
